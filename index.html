      Vild mad is an initiative that revolves around the wild, edible nature and how you can bring it into the kitchen. Nationwide. We believe that using wild ingredients in the kitchen can be part of a rich and forward-thinking lifestyle, so we have developed a range of tools and guides to help you become better at both finding them and using them in the kitchen. Since 2015, more than 100 people - from chefs and foragers to academics and designers - have been involved in building an ambitious resource for anyone interested. A handful of organizations have shared all their knowledge and expertise in the process.

      In the city, it's filled with apartment buildings, bike paths, and suburban streets. But did you know that you can also find herbs, berries, fruit? Many of the city's green areas are carefully maintained, so there are many places where there is not as much edible, and of course, you should avoid foraging near busy roads, industrial areas, or places where weed spraying occurs, as there is a risk of contamination. In the city center, there are also old parks where nature resembles that found in wild hedges, and where you may be lucky to find ramsons, wild apples, and forest strawberries. The many houses in the city retain the sun's warmth, so the average temperature is higher in the city than in the countryside. For the same reason, the foraging season in the city also starts earlier and ends later
